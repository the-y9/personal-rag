About Us

We are an early-stage company building intelligent systems that bring together cutting-edge AI, real-world applications, and user-first design. Our mission is to make artificial intelligence truly accessible and useful—through products that are intuitive, responsive, and deeply impactful.

As a small, high-performing team of builders, we thrive on experimentation, creative problem-solving, and rapid iteration. We move fast, learn constantly, and believe that big ideas deserve great execution.

If you’re excited to contribute to a product with real-world impact—and grow alongside engineers who care deeply about code quality, creativity, and clarity—you’ll feel right at home here.

The Role

We’re looking for a highly motivated Junior AI/ML Engineer to join our team and help bring intelligent features to life. You’ll work side-by-side with experienced engineers and product leaders to prototype, train, and deploy AI-powered tools across our platform.

This is a hands-on, high-growth opportunity for someone who’s eager to learn, experiment quickly, and contribute to the full AI/ML lifecycle—from data collection to deployment. You’ll be exposed to modern toolkits, vector databases, LLM workflows, and development approaches inspired by vibe coding—fast, intuitive, and iterative.

What You’ll Do

 Contribute to AI/ML Development: Support the design and implementation of models, embeddings, and search systems that power intelligent product features.
 Work with Modern Toolkits: Gain hands-on experience with state-of-the-art ML tools and frameworks—vector databases, transformers, cloud-based inference pipelines, and more.
 Prototype & Iterate: Help build quick, experimental prototypes using a vibe coding approach—learning through doing, testing, and improving.
 Data & Training: Assist in collecting, cleaning, labeling, and preprocessing data for model development and fine-tuning.
 Deploy Real Systems: Help integrate models into production, monitor performance, and iterate on solutions in a live environment.
 Collaborate & Learn: Work closely with senior engineers to grow your skills in both machine learning and software engineering best practices.

What We’re Looking For

 0–2 years of hands-on experience in AI/ML development (internships, personal projects, academic research all count).
 Proficiency in Python, with knowledge of key libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch or TensorFlow.
 Interest in embeddings, LLMs, and vector databases—or a strong desire to learn them quickly.
 Some exposure to cloud environments like GCP, AWS, or Azure is a plus.
 Comfort with experimentation and iteration—you’re not afraid to try things and fail fast.
 Strong problem-solving skills, curiosity, and a growth mindset.
 Excellent communication skills and a collaborative attitude.

Bonus Points

 Experience building or contributing to side projects involving AI or data science.
 Exposure to tools like Hugging Face, LangChain, Pinecone, or Weaviate.
 Basic understanding of how APIs, microservices, or full-stack systems work.
 Examples of creative problem-solving or self-initiated learning.

Why Join Us

 Accelerated Learning: You’ll be mentored by experienced engineers and gain exposure to the full AI/ML product lifecycle.
 Meaningful Work: Your ideas and contributions will directly shape real products and experiences.
 Creative Culture: We move fast, think big, and empower you to take ownership early.
 Growth-Oriented: We’re invested in helping you become the engineer you want to be.
 Flexible Environment: Work remotely or from our NYC hub, with the tools and autonomy to do your best work.

How to Apply

Send us your resume, links to any projects (GitHub, portfolio, notebooks), and a short note on why you’re excited about AI and what you hope to build. If you’ve experimented with AI models, vector databases, or vibe coding-style workflows, we’d love to hear about it.
