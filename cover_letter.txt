Respected Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Junior AI/ML Engineer position at Barsys, as advertised. As a final-year student at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, graduating in September 2025 with a BS in Data Science and Applications, I am eager to apply my skills and passion for AI to contribute to your team's mission of making artificial intelligence truly accessible and useful.

My academic background and hands-on experience have provided me with a strong foundation in AI/ML development. I have proficiency in Python and key libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn, which are essential for data preprocessing and model development. My interest in embeddings, LLMs, and vector databases aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role. For instance, in my project tracker project I used LLMs to to manage projects.

One project that highlights my capabilities is my work on Multi-Lingual Sentiment Analysis. This involved developing a deep learning model capable of classifying sentiment in text across 13 Indian languages, leveraging NLP techniques and tools like Meta's Llama 3 8B Instruct Model. I am also familiar with frameworks such as PyTorch and have experience with tools like Hugging Face, further enhancing my ability to contribute to the design and implementation of intelligent features. I am also familier with fastapi and flask frameworks.

I am currently working as a Developer Intern at IDEMIA, where I am developing and maintaining dynamic user interfaces using React.js and integrating FastAPI with an MS SQL database. This experience has provided me with practical exposure to full-stack systems and reinforced my understanding of software engineering best practices, which will enable me to seamlessly integrate models into production, monitor performance, and iterate on solutions in a live environment.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Barsys' innovative work and am eager to learn and grow alongside your experienced team. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
Yash Mishra
