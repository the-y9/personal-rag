Respected Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the Machine Learning/AI Role at CreateBytes, as advertised. As a final-year Data Science student at IIT Madras, graduating in September 2025, I am eager to apply my skills and passion for AI to build real-world solutions within a collaborative and innovative environment.

My academic background, coupled with hands-on project experience, has equipped me with a strong foundation in machine learning, deep learning, and NLP. Specifically, I have practical experience with ML libraries like PyTorch and Scikit-learn. For instance, I developed a "Mental Health Classifier" using Scikit-learn with ensemble methods, achieving 93.7% accuracy, showcasing my ability to build and evaluate robust classification models. Additionally, my project on "Multi-Lingual Sentiment Analysis" involved building a deep learning model using the Llama 3 8B Instruct Model to classify sentiment in text across 13 Indian languages, demonstrating my experience in NLP and handling large language models (LLMs).

Furthermore, my proficiency extends to model development, tuning, and deployment through projects like the "FAQ Bot," a semantic search-based chatbot. This project leverages Sentence-Transformers and FastAPI for efficient question answering, highlighting my skills in NLP, Python, and API development. As a Developer Intern at IDEMIA, I utilized React.js and FastAPI with an MS SQL database to develop user interfaces and automate data updates, further solidifying my abilities in full-stack development and backend connectivity.

I am particularly drawn to CreateBytes' commitment to building smart, scalable, and AI-driven solutions. I am confident that my problem-solving abilities, combined with my eagerness to learn and contribute, align perfectly with your team's values. I am open to a work-from-office role in Gurgaon and am excited about the opportunity to contribute to impactful AI applications.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of discussing how my skills and experiences can contribute to CreateBytes. I am available for an interview at your earliest convenience.

Sincerely,
