**Subject:** Application for AI/ML Internship  

**Dear Team,**

I am writing to express my interest in the AI/ML Internship opportunity at your organization. I hold a BSc in Data Science and Programming and am currently pursuing a BS in Data Science and Applications from IIT Madras. With a strong technical foundation and a deep passion for AI and machine learning, I am eager to contribute meaningfully to your team.

At present, I am interning as a developer at IDEMIA, where I am responsible for developing and maintaining dynamic, responsive user interfaces using React.js. My work includes implementing client-side routing, managing complex application state with Redux, and leveraging React Hooks to enhance performance and user experience. Additionally, I have integrated FastAPI with an MS SQL database to enable conditional rendering of data points by joining various master tables, facilitating robust and scalable backend connectivity.

My academic and personal projects have equipped me with practical experience in **Python**, **machine learning**, and **deep learning** frameworks such as **PyTorch**, with a focus on **transformer models** (HuggingFace). A few highlights include:

- **Mental Health Data Analysis**: Achieved 93.7% accuracy using an ensemble Voting Classifier across multiple ML algorithms.
- **Obesity Risk Prediction**: Used XGBoost and SVM for multi-class classification, reaching 83.67% accuracy.
- **Image Depth Estimation**: Implemented the **MiDaS** model to generate depth maps, enhancing image understanding through visualization.

Beyond AI/ML, I have actively contributed to diverse projects:

- **Business Data Analysis (Blue Star, UP Branch)**: Delivered data-driven insights to improve B2B operations.
- **Library Management System**: Built with **Flask** and **Vue.js**, featuring role-based access and backend automation using **Redis** and **Celery**.
- **Project Management Platform**: Developed a backend system for instructors to track student projects, integrating GitHub commit analysis, AI-based document evaluation, and Agile workflows.

In addition to my technical skills, I am experienced in **debugging**, **testing**, and collaborative development using **Git**. I thrive in dynamic environments, quickly adapt to new challenges, and am committed to continuous learning and growth.

I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to contribute to your organization and believe that my skills and enthusiasm for AI/ML align well with your mission.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

Best regards,  
**Yash Mishra**
